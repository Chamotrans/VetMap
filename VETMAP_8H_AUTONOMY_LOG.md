# VetMap 8-hour autonomy log

## Round 1 — Availability filter coverage disclosure

- Started: 2026-08-02 (Asia/Taipei)
- Sol plan: Active availability filters can currently return only clinics with current official hours data. Add an explicit call-first disclosure so users do not interpret an omitted clinic as closed.
- Luna implementation:
  - Added `ClinicSearchFilter.Availability.limitationMessage`.
  - Displayed the message in the shared list/map `ClinicFilterControls` for `openNow`, `open24Hours`, and `nightService`; `.all` remains unchanged.
  - Added a focused unit test covering all four availability states.
- Sol acceptance: **ACCEPT** — no blocker and no P0/P1/P2 finding. Exact copy, shared list/map presentation, VoiceOver label, layout, scope, and tests reviewed.
- Local evidence: `swiftc -parse` passed for the three touched Swift files; `git diff --check` passed. No local `xcodebuild` was run.
- Xcode Cloud: Pending the pushed commit for this round.
- Production/backend note: No Firebase, registration, submissions, community, moderation, or release-state logic changed. A fresh local Firebase audit was not claimed because `gcloud` requires interactive reauthentication.
- Preserved scope: Existing user-owned dirty and untracked files were not staged, reverted, or modified by this round.
